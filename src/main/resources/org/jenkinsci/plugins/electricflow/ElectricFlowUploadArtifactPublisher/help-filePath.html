<div>
    Specify the location or path for the artifact files to be published to CloudBees CD/RO.
    This field supports ant-style path pattern matching and build-time environment variables.
    <br/>For example: <br />
    <pre>
"?" matches one character. Application.?ar will match both Application.war and Application.jar.
"*" matches zero or more characters. Report.*ml will match Report.html and Report.xml.
"**" matches zero or more 'directories' in a path. target/**/*.war will match all war files in any directory inside "target"
    </pre>
    To reference environment variable value, "$" should be used. For example, to reference the current build number: $BUILD_NUMBER.
    <br />
    E.g., MyProject/**/*-$BUILD_NUMBER.war.
</div>
