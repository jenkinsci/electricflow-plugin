# CloudBees CD/RO plugin

CloudBees Continuous Deployment and Release Orchestration (CD/RO), formerly CloudBees CD, is 
an enterprise-grade DevOps release automation platform that simplifies 
provisioning, building, and releasing multi-tiered applications. 
Our model-driven approach for managing environments and applications 
allows teams to collaborate and coordinate across multiple pipelines and 
releases within hybrid infrastructures in an efficient, predictable, 
and auditable way.

# Plugin overview

The CloudBees CD plugin allows you to integrate CloudBees CD/RO features and APIs directly in your Jenkins instances. From running pipelines that compile your applications to deploying them, the CloudBees CD plugin helps reduce the inherent complexity of continuous deployment and release orchestration. For more information on the capabilities of this plugin, refer to [Plugin features](#plugin-features). 

# CloudBees CD/RO version dependencies

Starting with CloudBees CD/RO v2023.02.0, you must upgrade to CloudBees CD plugin v1.1.30 or later. Failure to do so will result in failed plugin procedures. Plugin versions v1.1.30 or later are backwards compatible with previous CloudBees CD/RO releases.

# Plugin features

The CloudBees CD plugin integrates the following features into your Jenkins instances to interact with CloudBees CD/RO:
-   [Connect to your CloudBees CD server](#connecting-to-your-cloudbees-cd-server)
-   [Call CloudBees CD REST APIs](#calling-cloudbees-cd-rest-api)  
-   [Create applications from deployment packages](#creating-and-deploying-applications-from-deployment-packages-to-cloudbees-cd) 
-   [Deploy applications](#deploying-applications-using-cloudbees-cd)
-   [Publish artifacts](#publishing-artifacts-to-cloudbees-cd)
-   [Run pipelines](#running-pipelines-in-cloudbees-cd)
-   [Run procedures](#running-procedures-in-cloudbees-cd)
-   [Trigger releases](#triggering-releases-in-cloudbees-cd)

# Connecting to your CloudBees CD server

To use and integrate with CloudBees CD/RO, you must
create a connection configuration in Jenkins to store your CloudBees CD/RO server information. Depending on the number of servers or environments you are integrating, you can create one or multiple connection configurations to connect with and call CloudBees CD/RO APIs.

To create and configure your connection:
1. Login into your Jenkins instance and navigate to **Manage Jenkins** > **Configure System**.
2. Under **Configurations**, find the **CloudBees CD** section and select **Add**. 
3. Specify the following information for your configuration:
   - **Configuration Name:** Name for this configuration.

   - **Server URL**: Your CloudBees CD/RO server URL. 

   - **REST API Version**: CloudBees CD/RO server REST API version.
4. Select **Save** in the Jenkins UI to confirm your configuration.
5. If you are redirected to another page, navigate back to **Manage Jenkins > Configure System**, and under **CloudBees CD > Configurations**, find the configuration you just created.
6. Add your **Credentials Type**:
    -   **Username and Password**: CloudBees CD/RO username and password for your connection.

    - **Stored Credential**: Used to configure authentication via stored credentials, which can be a username/password or secret text that supports an SSO session ID token.
    > **_TIP:_**  To configure a connection using an SSO session ID token, refer to [Configuring an SSO session ID token for CloudBees CD](#configuring-an-sso-session-id-token-for-cloudbees-cd).

7. Both **Do not send build details to CloudBees CD** and **Override CloudBees CD SSL Validation Check** are **optional** settings. You can select their **?** icons and read the descriptions to decide if you want to use these features.   
8. Select **Test Connection** to ensure your credential is working correctly. If you receive a ``Success`` message, your configuration is ready to use. If you receive an error code, ensure your **Server URL** is correct. If it is, typically there was an error in the credential configuration and the configuration should be reconfigured.

## Configuring an SSO session ID token for CloudBees CD
The CloudBees CD plugin allows you to authenticate actions using an SSO session ID token. Before starting:
- You must have a generated CloudBees SSO session ID token. If you have not generated a CloudBees SSO session ID token, refer to [Generate an SSO session ID token](https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-cd/latest/intro/sign-in-cd#_generate_a_sso_session_id_token) for help.
- You must have already set up a **CloudBees CD** configuration and saved it to Jenkins. If not, follow the steps in [Connecting to your CloudBees CD server](#connecting-to-your-cloudbees-cd-server) until **Credentials Type**. 

The following steps describe how to configure a CloudBees SSO session ID token within a CloudBees CD configuration.

1. Navigate to **Manage Jenkins** > **Configure System**. Under **CloudBees CD** > **Configurations**, find the configuration to which you want to add an SSO session ID token. 
2. Under **Credentials Type**, select **Stored Credential**. A new entry field opens.
3. For **Stored Credential**, select **Add** and **Jenkins**. A new window opens for the **Jenkins Credential Provider**.
4. By default, the **Domain** field is set to *Global credentials (unrestricted)* and is unchangeable. 
5. For **Kind**, select **Secret text**. 
6. Select the **Scope** you want to use your token for. 
7. In the **Secret** field, enter your CloudBees SSO session ID token. 
8. The **ID** field is **optional**. If you want to provide an **ID**, select the **?** icon and read the message to ensure you understand the purpose and requirements of this field.
9. The **Description** field is **optional**. However, it is suggested to provide one to help you keep track of the token configuration in your **Credentials**  profile.

> **_NOTE:_** Ensure the information for your credential is correct before moving to the next step. If your credential is configured with incorrect information, you cannot edit it, and must delete the credential and reconfigure a new one. 

10. Select **Add** to save the configuration. You are returned to the system configurations page.
> **_TIP:_**  Check your profile to ensure your credential was added and manage it. 
11. Select **Test Connection** to ensure your credential is working correctly. If you receive a ``Success`` message, your configuration is ready to use. If you receive an error code, ensure your **Server URL** is correct. If it is, typically there was an error in the credential configuration, and the configuration should be reconfigured.  

# Supported Post Build Actions

The CloudBees CD plugin enables you to perform post-build actions for your Jenkins jobs. These actions can be executed separately or combined sequentially. 

> **_NOTE:_** To manage **Post-build Actions**, navigate to your Jenkins job's **Configuration** > **Post-build Actions**. 

## Calling CloudBees CD REST API

The CloudBees CD plugin allows you to make calls to CloudBees CD/RO's REST API for post-build actions and as pipeline steps. For more information on using the CloudBees CD/RO REST API, refer to [Use the CloudBees CD/RO RESTful API](https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-cd-api-rest/latest/).  

To configure calls to CloudBees CD/RO's REST API:
1. Navigate to your job's **Configuration** > **Post-build Actions** menu.
2. Select **Add post-build action**.
3. In the filter field, enter `CloudBees CD - Call REST API`. 
4. Complete the fields with your configuration details. Select the **?** icon to view field information in a new dialog.
    > **_IMPORTANT:_** For API parameters that include the phrase, "`request=<API-NAME>` must appear in your query string" in their description, you must include `?request=<API-NAME>` in the **Path URL** field. For example:
    >
    >* `/objects?request=sendReportingData`: Where `?` designates a query string, `request` and `sendReportingData` are required by the `POST object` API. 
    
    > **_TIP:_** To reference CloudBees CD/RO REST API resources and descriptions, you can use CloudBees CD/RO's Swagger UI. To access the Swagger UI, navigate to `https://<cloudbees-cd-server_hostname>/rest/doc/v1.0/`, where `<cloudbees-cd-server_hostname>` is the host name or IP address of your CloudBees CD/RO server.
    >
    > For more information on the Swagger UI, refer to [Access the Swagger UI](https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-cd-api-rest/latest/#_access_the_swagger_ui).


5. To apply the configuration to your job, select **Save** in the Jenkins UI.

# Known issues
## Adding credentials to a new CloudBees CD configuration  
[BEE-27725] When creating a new CloudBees CD configuration, you cannot add a new credential using the **Add** button.
### Workarounds
You can use the following workarounds instead of the **Add** button to help you add a credential:
- The **Add** button works for existing configurations. Create and save your configuration without the credential. You can then return to the configuration and add the credential using the **Add** button.
- Add your credentials as described in Jenkins' [Configuring credentials](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/using/using-credentials/#configuring-credentials).
