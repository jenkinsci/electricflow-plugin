# CloudBees CD
CloudBees CD Application Release Orchestration.

# Overview

CloudBees CD is an enterprise-grade DevOps Release Automation platform
that simplifies provisioning, build and release of multi-tiered
applications. Our model-driven approach to managing environments and
applications allows teams to collaborate on and coordinate multiple
pipelines and releases across hybrid infrastructure in an efficient,
predictable and auditable way. 

# Features

With the CloudBees CD plugin you can:

-   Trigger a release in CloudBees CD
-   Trigger a pipeline in CloudBees CD
-   Deploy an application in CloudBees CD
-   Publish an artifact from Jenkins into the CloudBees CD artifact
    repository
-   Run a Procedure in CloudBees CD
-   Call a REST API to invoke any action in CloudBees CD
-   Create Application in CloudBees CD from Deployment Package

# Connection Configurations

In order to use and integrate with CloudBees CD, you would have to
create a connection configuration in Jenkins, that stores connection
information of the CloudBees CD Server you are connecting to. You can
create one or more connection configurations depending on the number of
Servers or Environments you are integrating with.

Navigate to Manage Jenkins / Configure System and go to CloudBees CD
section. One or more configurations can be created to connect to and
call APIs into CloudBees CD system. For each configuration, the
following attributes need to be specified:

-   Configuration Name: Specify the name to store this configuration,
    which is used to connect to the CloudBees CD Server.

-   Server URL: CloudBees CD Server URL

-   REST API Version: CloudBees CD Server Rest API Version

-   User Name: CloudBees CD user name for Connection

-   User Password: CloudBees CD password for Connection

-   Do not send build details to CloudBees CD:
    By default, if the build has been triggered by CloudBees CD using CI configuration build details will be sent.
    Use this setting if you do not want to be sending build details to this CloudBees CD instance.

-   Override CloudBees CD SSL Validation Check: By default SSL
    Validation Check will be performed. Choose this setting to override
    the check. If you do not want to override this check, perform the
    SSL certificate setup required in Jenkins and CloudBees CD as per
    the CloudBees CD Server documentation.

```groovy
//...
script {
    try {
        // Note that both 'dependOnCdJobOutcome' and 'throwExceptionIfFailed' properties of the RunAndWait option should be set to true.
        cloudBeesFlowRunProcedure configuration: 'electricflow', procedureName: 'prepareDeployment', procedureParameters: '{"procedure":{"procedureName":"prepareDeployment","parameters":[]}}', projectName: 'CloudBees', runAndWaitOption: [dependOnCdJobOutcome: true, throwExceptionIfFailed: true]

            currentBuild.result = 'UNSTABLE'
        } else if (ex.getMessage() =~ 'outcome=error') {
            currentBuild.result = 'FAILURE'
            unstable("The 'prepareDeployment' CD job was finished with error and the CI build should be stopped.")
            throw ex
        }
    }
}
//...
```

# Known issues
## Adding credentials to a new CloudBees CD configuration  
[BEE-27725] When creating a new Cloudbees CD configuration, you cannot add a new credential using the "Add" button.
### Workarounds
The following workarounds may be used instead of the "Add" button to help you add a credential:
- The "Add" button works for existing configurations. So, create your configuration without the credential and then edit the configuration.
- Add your credential in any other place.
